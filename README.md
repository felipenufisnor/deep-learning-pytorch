In this deep learning project, I used PyTorch to implement a training and validation flow for a neural network. 
I verified the importance of defining hyperparameters during the training phase. 
I was able to practice loading custom datasets and datasets from the Torchvision package with PyTorch.
Finally, I tested the most used optimizers in neural network training.
